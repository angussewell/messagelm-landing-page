This is a Next.js marketing website for a company that sells AI-powered tools for businesses called MessageLM.

MessageLM is an AI sales enablement and outreach software that helps businesses and sales reps write really human-like and quality messages using AI. The focus is on GTM teams who want to who don't want to just AI spam bunch of people. 

Essentially, a lot of how previous AI agent software and agentic AI that is meant for sales is typically meant to save people time on writing scenarios, writing sequences, and writing sales messages. This typically ends up creating a really mediocre output when it comes to sales messages. And there isn't really a software out there that focuses more on creating really high-quality sales messages and creating really high-quality automated lead magnets. Overall just focusing more on customer experience and that's what we do.

It is a platform that combines consultants and software to provide a really high-level, high-end experience to prospects. It is essentially getting high-quality output through really high-quality prompt engineering, and that is kind of what we're about: enabling people to use intuitive software to prompt an engineer and to tailor the messaging to be highly relevant, highly valuable, and very highly human-sounding.

Much of AI, especially in AI outbound messaging, sounds spammy, it sounds AI, it's on salesy, and we are trying to avoid that at all costs. We want to sound human, run a sound authentic, and use reciprocity to our advantage whenever we can.

Right now, essentially, if you were to work with us, it would be a you would get basically a team of sales message writers and prompt engineers as well as the software to assist you when it comes to writing this writing any scenarios and sequences that you need. 

The software works by combining a whole series of things: scenarios (essentially specific touchpoints). For example, a LinkedIn message, an email, a document shared on Google Drive. These scenarios combine different types of touchpoints and different things to create really convincing and unique messages that prospects have never seen before. 

The whole software is going to be custom-tailored to you and custom-built to you. Each of these scenarios is going to be a hyper-focused, hyper-trained AI model that is specifically focused on outputting one specific message that you want to send to a group of people. 

What we do Is custom build this software and this AI for companies so that they can plug this software into their CRM and turn the CRM into a sophisticated sales tool. I don't want to use the word "AI agent" as it can sound clich√©, but essentially this outreach software can be used for cold outreach, following up with inbound leads, and engaging with people who interact with content and a whole variety of different things.

I think this custom nature needs to be a core part of it. It's like we like every business is different, and you don't want to settle for some sort of generic AI. We will build it around your CRM and make it easy for you to use. So much of additional software will basically kind of clutter your tech stack and make things more complicated and add more steps into the process. We want to make sure you're integrated with your CRM to basically turn your CRM into a super powered up AI outbound software. 

At the same time, it's not really just a software. The main default thing is we will come in and provide our expertise when it comes to prompt engineering and making sure it's all custom built for you and continually optimized and continually written these new scenarios for you for new situations and new context. If you want to do a different outbound campaign, if you want to follow up with a group of people (e.g., some people attended a webinar of yours). You want to follow up with them. You have that team there to make to write it for you and get it ready for to for you to basically click send. 

The goal is to wow your prospects and to provide a really just incredible experience that they've never seen from any other company.

We want to position ourselves far away from the quote-unquote AI agents of the world, the traditional AI sales software, and all of the spammy AI softwares that exist. Those types of software can save you time when it comes to writing that content, but they won't provide a very good output and won't provide a very good experience. It'll just output a very traditional salesy message. 

The only version available of this service/software is the full consulting service. It's hard to say, it's kind of a service/software, it's both. Is this where we'll come in and we'll provide this service for you? Coming soon, there's going to be a version, a standalone version of the software where you can do it yourself, prompt yourself, and maybe you can have a waitlist or something. 

It does need to be clear this is really built for B2B companies and people with a sales team. The kind of story we want to tell is: "So much of this software is sucky and won't provide that really high-end customer experience that people want. In order to get that high-end experience, you do need something custom - something where the AI is under your full control. And how you do that is by getting through prompt engineering these scenarios essentially." and we make that happen for you. and we make it easy, as well. 

When it comes to the pricing of things, a lot of this isn't on a credit-based system. It's similar to Cursor, similar to OpenAI. It needs to be clear though. You can call these credits, you can call them requests, or something else. It's hard to say what the best word for it is. But the kind of this whole done for you and I would not use the word done for you, but it's the plan that where we come in and do everything starts at $1,500 a month. And the version where that's just the software product starts at $300 a month. And you can say that both plans come with like 5,000 credits/requests per per month. Probably don't need to include any more. What the credits cost isn't explicitly stated, but essentially each credit is going to be a fraction of a cent. Basically, after that. You don't really need to include that information, though. 

There's a kind of whole different aspects of this, and we do need to unify the story and provide a little bit of a better overview that makes sense to people. A lot of this is pretty complicated and doesn't make sense up front, so we do need to make it simple for people to understand. But at the same time, this is something that is built for established companies with sales teams. This is not some sort of done-for-you agency or some sort of shitty software that has a lot of scammy marketing around it. This is a sophisticated product, and it needs to have that venture capital-backed Silicon Valley tech feel to things. 

When telling the story of this company, you cannot make it seem like either a software or an agency or really a consulting firm. You need to make it clear, especially not a software, because people are going to if they think it's a software, people have a certain price for software. But at the same time, you can't make it seem like an agency. The closest thing you could probably do is some sort of consulting firm, but probably make a more like custom software or something like that. But you can't make it either. But again, make sure it does not come across as a software or an agency. 

When telling the story of this product and telling the story of how we do this and the copy and everything, we want to avoid any language that comes across as traditional marketing language that comes across as salesy or scammy. We do want to tell a story in a compelling way, of course, but anything that comes across as like a marketingy kind of clickfunnels type of thing needs to be completely avoided. We need to come across as a little bit more sophisticated. 

At the same time, this is something that the whole thing around it is to sound human and humans have personality. They don't speak in averages; they have a little bit of uniqueness, more depth, and that's what I want the copy and this story to have - a subtle personality to it, very subtle. We have to be very delicate with this because if we go over the top, it's going to sound goofy, silly. So we need to be very careful with that. 

When it comes to design and how we design the homepage, I would look at probably websites such as the Notebook LM website or the Cursor website that has this beautiful AI-kind of feeling. Impress and wow with a really great custom experience. 

A kind of our core value here is really customer experience and high-end customer experience so that kind of needs to come across and we need to display. We need to walk the walk here when it comes to creating this so the website needs to be stunning.
